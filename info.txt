we have to talk about package distribution EVENTUALLY
    where to draw the line? matter of taste
    for Backpack, we do it because it's in Haskell
    also, you need this modularity precisely for things on different sides of the planet so that's what Hackage is for

sounds simple but is complicated
    (the PhD problem is in reverse)
    generative applicative / it depends on what you expect
    module level granularity is a compromise

docs
    example
        top-level
            vanilla
                point out that p and q could be in the single bkp, or separate
            package with hole
        each section
        2.6 mention pkgdb_field
            bin-package-db
    "installed-ids" in field grammar versus "id"
    Cabal wants to find as many installed things as possible
        Cabal indiscriminately says what is installed
            but this is not necessary UNLESS there can be multiple ipids per package key
    package ::= installed package | package
    Cabal can put one or lots of packages in one
        lens-linked/lens
        distinguish with the Cabal selection for a signature

comments in GhcMonad.hs
    Session is an IORef to HscEnv (HscEnv is like Session: fix this)

FinderCache should record what the package it is from
    it does seem like hsc_MLC and hsc_FC are updated together (a pair)
    so call the combined thing FinderCache

We're not caching file system information for packages at all!

goal: abandon FinderCache, by storing home package stuff <thisPackage, moduleName>
